	- [ ] Monastic land value, dummy, no surnames until later
	- [ ] interact treatment with prev wealth percentile
	- [x] Matching (1-5 NN) + pair FEs
	- [x] Doubly-Robust Estimator
	- [ ] Weight by number of surname bearers
	- [ ] Subsample of rare and Devon-specific names, find them in the later 19th c
	- [ ] Land concentration or de-concentration?
	- [ ] Thresholds for plot size?
	- [x] Use "control group" as reference category, even with whole sample
	- [x] Embeddings + cosine distance for name linking
	- [ ] Find land quality indicators?
	- [ ] Indicators for nearness of different cities / divide into agricultural hinterlands
	- [ ] Borrowing to buy land mechanically moves you up the wealth distribution!
- [ ] Reading:
	- [x] Bleakley and Ferrie
	- [ ] Spanish, French, etc. dissolutions
- [ ] Presentation:
	- [ ] Visualize surname links
	- [ ] Make the pre-period clearer
	- [ ] Too many tables! Get some reg plots!
	- [ ] Divide into lists, mobility regs, structure regs, introduce data right in front of each
	- [ ] Eliminate control variable coefs from tables
	- [ ] Vertical shading for purchase period
	- [ ] Andres: go from macro to micro: here are the headline results, then the mechanisms
Meeting Feedback:
- [ ] Chris:
	- [ ] Try to nail the intro, base it on presentations
	- [ ] Keep it all in -- maybe separate HRV section if you can't defend it
	- [ ] Clean up Table 1, more descriptive
	- [ ] Match treatment and control, only compare the two! Look up matching estimator
	- [ ] Check position of constants in regression tables
	- [ ] Table 5 vs 6:
		- [ ] Think about how effects from each hypothesis should scale (or not)
		- [ ] Make "other" category clearer as services/commercial 
		- [x] Get data on pre-existing markets?
		- [ ] Find an "in-between" level of aggregation, maybe 4-parish level or something
	- [ ] Read *On Copyhold: Tenure and the Land Market* by Hoyle?
	- [ ] Don't use regressions as *motivators* for the text, focus on research questions and motivations
	- [ ] Bit more history-friendly writing or just clearer and more narrative-driven?
- [ ] Jordan:
	- [ ] More explicit! Don't presume knowledge!
	- [ ] Clearer antecedents, less dangling "they"s
	- [ ] Link up RQs to *all* literatures
	- [ ] Paragraphs for RQs
	- [ ] **Reason** for each source!
	- [ ] Lit for treatment/control / PSM
	- [ ] Connective tissue anchored in RQs and whole research idea
	- [ ] "Status-loaded" defined earlier!
	- [ ] Sources for data in each table

Oxford Feedback: 
- [ ] Migration
- [ ] Local inequality / "optimum" inequality for development
- [ ] Check name matching validity through W+S parish reconstruction
- [ ] Try multiple control groups, slightly wealthier than treatment
- [ ] Social connections vs wise investments = IMPORTANT
- [ ] Growth in stock of secular wealth over time?
