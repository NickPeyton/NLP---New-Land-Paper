40	9402	HC	D1	Huntingdon	1 church & its land	Eustace the sheriff	Burgred & Thorkil	Abbey of Thorney	Burgred and Thorkil	Burgred & Thorkil	Eustace the sheriff	['Hurstingstone' Hundred]	"B12. 19,9"	"Burgred and Thorkil re-state their claim in B12; on the fief of Eustace the sheriff (19,9) they are represented as tenants."	"The men who have sworn in Huntingdon say that the Church of St Mary in the Borough and the land that belongs to it was the Church of Thorney's; but the Abbot gave it in pledge to the burgesses. However, King Edward gave it to Vitalis and Bernard, his priests; they sold it to Hugh, King Edward's chamberlain. But Hugh sold it to two priests of Huntingdon, for which they have King Edward's seal. Eustace ^[the sheriff]^ now has it without deliverer, without writ and without installer."
60	9403	HC	D2	Huntingdon	1 house	Eustace the sheriff	Oger of London	-	Alwin the sheriff	Leofeva	Eustace the sheriff	['Hurstingstone' Hundred]	B10	"Leofeva may be the widow of Aelfric the sheriff, whose wife and children were deprived of their residence by Eustace despite confirmation by royal grant (B10). Oger is not recorded elsewhere in Huntingdonshire."	Eustace [* the sheriff *] took Leofeva's house by force and gave it to Oger of London.
80	9404	HC	D3	Huntingdon	3 hides & 16 houses	Countess Judith	Countess Judith	King Edward	Hunef <of Stukeley> & Gos	Eustace the sheriff	Countess Judith	['Hurstingstone' Hundred]	"B14. 20,3"	"The title of Countess Judith had apparently been challenged, perhaps by Eustace who claimed the manor (20,3) to which these houses were probably attached."	"They testify that the land of Hunef <of Stukeley> and Gos was in King Edward's hands on the day of his death, and that they held from him, not from the Earl [* Waltheof *]. But they say that they heard that King William should have given it to [* Earl *] Waltheof."
100	9405	HC	D4	Broughton	5 hides	Abbey of Ramsey	Abbey of Ramsey	Abbey of Ramsey	Freemen	Eustace the sheriff	Abbey of Ramsey	['Hurstingstone' Hundred]	"6,3"	"Eustace claimed 5 hides in 6,3, probably these 5. This entry sets out the grounds on which Ramsey held the disputed 5 hides, without mentioning Eustace."	"Concerning the 5 hides at Broughton, they say that it was Freemen's land in King Edward's time, but that the same king gave the land and the jurisdiction over them to St Benedict's of Ramsey, because of a service which Abbot Alwin did for him in Saxony; and that since then [the Abbey] has always had it."
120	9406	HC	D5	[Huntingdon]	reeveland	King William	King William	King Edward	Brictmer Balehorn	Borough of Huntingdon?	King William	['Hurstingstone' Hundred]	-	Brictmer does not occur elsewhere in DB Huntingdonshire. The entry is apparently concerned to establish that the reeveland should contribute to the farm of the borough paid to the king and earl.	The County testifies that the land of Brictmer Balehorn was reeveland before 1066 and belonged to the [Borough] revenue.
140	9407	HC	D6	[Huntingdon]	land	Abbey of Ramsey?	Abbey of Ramsey?	Abbey of Ramsey?	Alwin the priest	Abbey of Ramsey?	King William?	['Hurstingstone' Hundred]	-	"Alwin the priest does not occur elsewhere in DB Huntingdonshire, and no Alwin occurs on the land of any abbey. The entry is apparently concerned to establish the status of the land Alwin had held. The reeve's land may refer back to D5."	They testify that the land of Alwin the priest was the Abbot's; and that each was the priest's and the reeve's land respectively.
160	9408	HC	D7	Yelling & Hemingford [Grey]	16 hides	Aubrey de Vere	Ralph son of Osmund	Abbey of Ramsey	Aelfric <of Yelling>	Abbey of Ramsey	Aubrey de Vere	[Toseland Hundred]	"22,1-2"	"The abbey held in both vills (6,15-16). Boxted in Essex was held by an Aelfric (20,37), presumably the same man, although there is no mention of the abbey's claim there. There are no other traceable connections between Aubrey, Aelfric or the abbey."	"They testify that the lands of Aelfric <of Yelling> in Yelling and Hemingford [Grey] were St Benedict's ^[of Ramsey]^; and that they were granted to Aelfric for his lifetime on this condition that after his death they should have returned to the church, and Boxted with them. However Aelfric himself was killed in the battle at Hastings, and the Abbot recovered his lands, until Aubrey de Vere dispossessed him."
180	9409	HC	D8	Hemingford [Abbots]	2 hides	Abbey of Ramsey	Ralph son of Osmund	Abbey of Ramsey	Alwin Black & Godric	Abbey of Ramsey	Ralph son of Osmund	[Toseland Hundred]	"6,17.  27,1"	"Godric's hide, and the abbey's title and claim, is recorded in 6,17; the other, waste, hide constituted Ralph's fief, entered at 27,1 without comment. Ralph held in Hemingford Grey & Yelling (22,1-2), also claimed by the abbey: see D7."	"Concerning the 2 hides which Ralph son of Osmund holds in Hemingford [Abbots], they say that one of them was [part] of the lordship of the Church of Ramsey in King Edward's day and that he holds it against the Abbot's will. Concerning the other hide, they say that Godric held it from the Abbot, but when the Abbot was in Denmark, Ralph's father, Osmund, seized it from Saewin the falconer, to whom the Abbot had given it out of [his] love for the King."
200	9410	HC	D9	Waresley	1/2 hide	Eustace the sheriff	Roger	Thorulf	Sumarlithi <of Waresley>	King William?	Eustace the sheriff	[Toseland Hundred]	"19,26"	"Sumarlithi was the predecessor of Eustace but the jurors deny that this conferred title. Neither Thorulf or Sumarlithi appear elsewhere in Huntingdonshire so it is not apparent on whose behalf this statement was made, unless it be the king."	"Concerning Sumarlithi <of Waresley>, they say that he held his land ^[in Waresley]^ from Thorulf, who gave it to him, and afterwards from his sons, and that they had full jurisdiction over him."
220	9411	HC	D10	[Hail] Weston	2 hides	Robert (son of) Fafiton	Robert (son of) Fafiton	Earl Harold	Young Wulfwin	William of Warenne?	Robert (son of) Fafiton	[Toseland Hundred]	"25,1"	"The jurors presumably mean that this holding should not descend with Kimbolton, held by William of Warenne in 1086 (13,1), implicitly supporting Robert's title: see also D17-18."	"They say that the land of Young Wulfwin in [Hail] Weston was a manor in its own right, and did not belong to Kimbolton; but that nevertheless he was Earl Harold's man."
240	9412	HC	D11	[Hail] Weston	1 1/2 hides	Eustace the sheriff	Eustace the sheriff	Earl Tosti	Algeat <of Weston>	Countess Judith	Eustace the sheriff	[Toseland Hundred]	"19,27"	"Judith's claim is re-stated in the entry for Eustace's fief (19,27). The jurors imply that the sheriff's predecessor did not confer title, supporting the claim of Countess Judith as heir to her husband, Earl Waltheof, Algeat's lord."	"Concerning the 1 1/2 hides of land ^[in [Hail] Weston]^ which were Algeat <of Weston>'s, the men who have sworn say that Alfgeat held them himself from Earl Tosti, with full jurisdiction, and afterwards from [* Earl *] Waltheof."
260	9413	HC	D12	Boughton	1 hide	Eustace the sheriff	Eustace the sheriff	Earl Waltheof	Godric the priest	Countess Judith?	Eustace the sheriff	[Toseland Hundred]	"19,31"	"Judith's claim is not re-stated in the entry for Eustace's fief (19,31). The jurors imply that the sheriff's predecessor did not confer title, supporting the claim of Countess Judith as heir to her husband, Earl Waltheof, Godric's lord."	Godric the priest likewise held 1 hide of land ^[in Boughton]^ from Earl Waltheof before 1066. Now Eustace ^[the sheriff]^ holds it.
280	9414	HC	D13	[Hail] Weston	1/2 hide	Eustace the sheriff	Eustace the sheriff	-	Godwin	Robert (son of) Fafiton	Eustace the sheriff	[Toseland Hundred]	"19,28"	"The jurors implicitly support the tenure of Eustace against a possible but unrecorded claim by Robert, who acquired another holding in Weston from Saxi (25,1)."	"They say that the land of Godwin in [Hail] Weston in no way belonged to Saxi, the predecessor of ^[Robert son of]^ Fafiton."
300	9415	HC	D14	Swineshead	3 1/2 hides	William of Warenne	Eustace the sheriff	-	Earl Harold	Eustace the sheriff?	William of Warenne?	['Leightonstone' Hundred]	"13,3"	"By emphasising Earl Harold's tenure of this dependency of Kimbolton, the jurors may be supporting Warenne's title against an unrecorded claim by Eustace the sheriff, his tenant."	"The men of the County testify that King Edward gave Swineshead to Earl Siward [and] full jurisdiction, and so Earl Harold had it in the same way except that [its men] paid tax in the Hundred, and went with them against the enemy."
320	9416	HC	D15	Swineshead	1/2 hide	Eustace the sheriff	Ralph	King Edward	Fursa	King William?	Eustace the sheriff	['Leightonstone' Hundred]	"19,11"	"The implication is that Fursa's land was not held with full jurisdiction, as stated in 19,11, and that Eustace's title was not well-founded."	"Concerning Fursa's land, it was a jurisdiction of the King [* in Swineshead *]."
340	9417	HC	D16	Pertenhall	1 virgate	Bishop of Lincoln	William	King Edward	Alwin Devil	King William	Bishop of Lincoln	['Leightonstone' Hundred]	"2,9"	"In 2,9 the  royal officers claim the virgate for the king's use; Pertenhall was possibly part of Kimbolton."	"Concerning Alwin Devil's 1 virgate of land in Pertenhall, King Edward had the jurisdiction."
360	9418	HC	D17	Catworth	1 hide	William of Warenne	Eustace the sheriff	King Edward	Young Wulfwin	Eustace the sheriff?	William of Warenne	['Leightonstone' Hundred]	"13,4?"	"In emphasising King Edward's jurisdiction and denying Harold's tenure, the jurors appear to impugn Warenne's title, possibly supporting an unrecorded claim by Eustace (the sheriff), his tenant: see also D10;18."	They say that the hide of land which Young Wulfwin had in Catworth was in the King's jurisdiction and that Earl Harold did not have it.
380	9419	HC	D18	Little Catworth	1 hide	William of Warenne	Thorth	King Edward	Young Wulfwin	Countess Judith	William of Warenne	['Leightonstone' Hundred]	"13,5"	"The jurors appear to be supporting a claim based upon jurisdiction buttressed by royal grant, against Warenne's rights to the dependencies of Kimbolton: see also D10;17."	In Little Catworth the same ^[Young]^ Wulfwin had 1 hide over which King Edward always had full jurisdiction; but he could give and sell the land to whom he would. But the Countess' ^[Judith]^ men say that the King gave the land to Earl Waltheof.
400	9420	HC	D19	Easton	1/3 of 1/2 hide	Abbey of Ely	Abbey of Ely	-	Abbey of Ely	Abbey of Ely	Eustace the sheriff	['Leightonstone' Hundred]	"4,4"	"The sheriff's depredation is not mentioned in the entry which records the abbey's holding in Easton (4,4)"	The County testifies that the third part of 1/2 hide which lies in Easton and pays tax in Bedfordshire belongs to the Abbot of Ely's manor of Spaldwick. The Abbot had it in the same way before 1066 and for 5 years after the arrival of King William. Eustace [* the sheriff *] seized this [land] by force from the church and kept it.
420	9421	HC	D20	Keyston	4 hides	King William	King William	-	King Edward	King William	Eustace the sheriff	['Leightonstone' Hundred]	"1,7"	"The sheriff's depredation is not mentioned in the entry which records the King's holding (1,7), where Ranulf son of Ilger is stated to be 'in charge'."	"They say that Keyston was and is [part] of King Edward's revenue; and although Aelfric the sheriff resided in that village, yet he always paid the King's revenue from it, and his sons after him, until Eustace ^[the sheriff]^ received the sheriffdom; they have never seen or heard of the sealed [writ] of ?r? King Edward's which had put it outside his revenue."
440	9422	HC	D21	[Great] Gidding	4.5 hides	Eustace the sheriff	Ingelrann	King Edward	Alwold and his brothers	Alwold and his brothers	Eustace the sheriff	['Leightonstone' Hundred]	"19,15"	"The claim is repeated in 19,15 where William the artificer also claimed part of the land; he held elsewhere in the vill (26,1)."	"Alwold and his brothers claim that Eustace ^[the sheriff]^ unjustly took away from them their land ^[in [Great] Gidding]^. The County denies that they have seen the seal, or an installer who had put him in possession of it."
460	9423	HC	D22	[Great] Gidding	-	King William	King William	-	King Edward	King William	Eustace the sheriff?	['Leightonstone' Hundred]	"1,6"	"The statement is repeated in 1,6. None of the holdings in Gidding are identified as outliers so the purpose of this pronouncement is unclear."	"In 1066 [Great] Gidding was an outlier of Alconbury, in the King's revenue."
480	9424	HC	D23	Buckworth	10 hides	(Robert) Count of Eu	(Robert) Count of Eu	-	(Earl) Tosti	Countess Judith	(Robert) Count of Eu	['Leightonstone' Hundred]	"10,1"	"Buckworth is recorded as a manor in 1086 (10,1). Paxton was held by Countess Judith (20,8) so the statement may imply a claim on her behalf, though none is recorded. Tosti held both Buckworth and Paxton before 1066"	The County testifies that Buckworth was an outlier of [Great] Paxton before 1066.
500	9425	HC	D24	Brampton	15 hides	King William	King William	-	King Edward	Richard the artificer	King William	['Leightonstone' Hundred]	"1,8"	Richard's holding is not recorded but was probably part of the royal manor of 15 hides (36  is an error). He was presumably trying to avoid paying dues on the grounds that his was exempt Forest land.	"They say that the 36 hides of land in Brampton, which Richard the artificer claims belong to the Forest, were [part] of the King's lordship revenue, and did not belong to the Forest."
520	9426	HC	D25	Grafham	5 hides	Eustace the sheriff	Eustace the sheriff	-	King Edward	King William	Eustace (the sheriff)	['Leightonstone' Hundred]	"19,22?"	"Eustace held 1/2 hide (possibly a duplicate of part of 1,9) in Grafham (19,22) which this statement could allude to and so also to the royal manor at 1,9."	They say that Grafham was and is a jurisdiction of the King's and that they have seen neither writ nor installer who had delivered it to Eustace [* the sheriff *].
540	9427	HC	D26	Conington	6 hides	Countess Judith	Countess Judith	Abbey of Thorney	Thorkil (the Dane)	Abbey of Thorney	Countess Judith	[Normancross Hundred]	"20,1"	"The bare facts are repeated in the entry in Countess Judith's fief, implicitly supporting the title of the abbey to 6 of the 9 hides of that entry."	"Concerning the 6 hides in Conington, they said that they had heard that they formerly lay in [the lands] of the Church of Thorney and that they had been granted to Thorkil [* the Dane *] on this condition that after his death they should return to the church with the other 3 hides of the same village. They said that they had heard but had not seen this, nor had they been involved in it."
560	9428	HC	D27	Sawtry	3 hides & 3 1/2 virgates	Eustace the sheriff	Walter (of Beaumais)	-	Tosti <of Sawtry>	Abbey of Ramsey	Eustace the sheriff	[Normancross Hundred]	"19,1"	"This land was held by Eustace (19,1), where there is no reference to this claim. The jurors support the title of the abbey against the tenure of Eustace and his tenant."	"Concerning the land of Tosti <of Sawtry> in Sawtry, they say that his brother Erik <of Tealby> bequeathed it by name to the Church of Ramsey after the death of himself, his brother and his sister."
580	9429	HC	D28	[Old] Fletton	5 hides	Abbey of Peterborough	Abbey of Peterborough	-	Abbey of Peterborough	Abbey of Peterborough	Abbey of Peterborough	[Normancross Hundred]	"8,1"	The abbey held the only holding in Fletton at both dates so it is unclear what prompted this affirmation of its title.	"Concerning [Old] Fletton, they say that in King Edward's day it all lay in [the lands of] the Church of Peterborough, and ought to lie there."
600	9430	HC	D29	Orton [Waterville]	3 hides & 1 virgate	Bishop of Lincoln	Bishop of Lincoln	Bishop of Dorchester	Leofric	Bishop of Lincoln	King William	[Normancross Hundred]	"2,6"	The Bishopric of Lincoln was established in 1072 so this detail is anachronistic.	"Concerning Leofric's land ^[in Orton [Waterville]]^, they say that it was in the King's jurisdiction, but Bishop Remigius has shown the writ of King Edward by which he gave Leofric, with all [his] land, to the Bishopric of Lincoln, with full jurisdiction."
640	17334	YC	CN1	Fyling_[Old_Hall]	1 carucate	Earl Hugh	William of Percy	-	Earl Siward	Earl Hugh	William of Percy	[North Riding {Maneshou} Wapentake]	"13N1. SN,L1"	"William of Percy held a carucate in Fyling on his own fief and another ar part of the manor of Whitby, held from Earl Hugh; the claim evidently relates to the former. YS accords a carucate each to Hugh and William"	"For copyright reasons, the text for Yorkshire cannot be displayed."

SN,Ma21"	"The 6 bovates are recorded as a gift by Ulf to the Canons (2N15); Ralph held the remainder of the 6-carucate vill as a jurisdiction of his manor of Nunnington (16N1), acquired from Merleswein. YS agrees with DB about both Stonegrave holdings."	"For copyright reasons, the text for Yorkshire cannot be displayed."

SN,A3-4) - all without tenants - Havarthr's only other holding was the manor of Stokesley (29N8) and its dependencies (29N9) held by Uhtred in DB but by the king in YS. See also CE34."

SE,C5"	"These 2 carucates are recorded in YS and may be the one carucate each attributed to the king (1Y6) and to Northmann (29E5) in DB; but see SE,C5 note to the printed text."

SE,C8"	The holding of Barn and Ulf is not separately recorded in DB. YS attributed 2 carucates in Ellerton to both the King and the Count of Mortain but DB records only the Mortain holding (5E24).	"For copyright reasons, the text for Yorkshire cannot be displayed."
780	17341	YC	CE3	Middleton [on the Wolds]	1 carucate	Count of Mortain	Nigel Fossard	-	Mulagrimr	King William?	Nigel Fossard	[East Riding {Sneculfcros} Wapentake]	"SE,Sn1"	"YS attributes 12 carucates and 1 1/3 bovates to the Count of Mortain, of which 4 carucates and 2 bovates do not appear in DB; this holding is one of them though it might be included in 5E21; see also CE4-7."

"Nigel had 8 carucates in Dalton (acquired from Northmann and others) according to DB, 6 in YS, where the King is accorded 3.625 carucates not described in DB; Northmann's share may have been included in this though the totals still do not match exactly."

DB attributes a manor of 12.75 carucates to the Canons; YS 14.25 (SE,Sn7), which may therefore include this carucate though the totals still do not match. Earl Morcar had held Welton (3Y1)."

Kolgrim held in the same vill, but acquired his holding from a different predecessor, Roald (67,13). Both holdings were connected to 'Towthorpe', providing several possible sources of conflict."	"Also in Belton Kolgrim ought to have 1 bovate of land of Algar's land which Guy of Craon has, but the jurisdiction belongs to Guy in `Towthorpe'."

They say that before 1066 Young Leofric withheld the {warnode} of 10 acres of meadow also in Belton. Kolgrim claims the jurisdiction of these 10 acres.

"They say that the whole of the customs [due] to the church and the tithe from `Westhorpe' belong to the church of Grantham, as Bishop Osmund claims."

"In Honington hundred Gilbert claims the jurisdiction of 2 1/2 carucates of land through his predecessor Ulf, but the Wapentake says that Ivo ought to have the jurisdiction as Azur, his predecessor, had it from Ulf."

"Robert of Stafford claims 2 mills which are in Barkston, and Kolsveinn [* of Lincoln *] likewise claims them. The Wapentake says that they lie in Marston and their jurisdiction in Grantham."

"In Drayton hundred Count Alan has 1 carucate of land from St Benedict's of Ramsey. Bishop Remigius claims it and the Wapentake bears witness in favour of him that ^[Bishop]^ Wulfwige, his predecessor, held it from St Benedict's before 1066."

Algar is not named."	"Guy of Craon holds 4 bovates of land in Drayton and 10 bovates in Bicker hundred from the land of Aethelstan son of Godram. Count Alan claims these, and Algar, his man, has given a pledge to the King's barons to establish by court-judgement or by combat that Aethelstan ^[son of Godram]^ himself was not in possession of these 14 bovates before 1066. Against this Guy's man, Alstan of Frampton, has given his pledge to prove that he was in possession of them with full jurisdiction, and that Guy was in possession of them from the time of Ralph the constable until now, and he holds them now."

"The men of Holland testify that Healfdene [* son of Topi *], Bishop Remigius's predecessor, had in Steyning 3 carucates of land without interference which Count Alan now has and [has] wrongfully because the Bishop was in possession of them."

"Gyrthr, Count Alan's man, gave a pledge to affirm that Count Alan's predecessor had 6 bovates of land with full jurisdiction in Gosberton and therefore Guy of Craon does not claim them rightly."

The sixth carucate is probably included in 12,83 & 1,32. None mention a royal gift."	The 6 carucates of land which the King's officers claim in Holbeach lay in the King's manor of Gedney. Now Count Alan has them as one manor by the King's gift.
