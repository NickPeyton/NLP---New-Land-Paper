Some subsequent building has been added, evidenced by vignetted rather than solid tint infill.  The plans were originally folded 2 x 2, and lived in a box 25.5 X 17.5 inches broad by 28.5 inches deep; some have since been conserved and flattened, but some are still kept in the box, which has a plinthed bottom and a protruding lid.  The plans were originally edged with green silk, and some have a mark `Warranted' and `Samuel Kidd & Son Dundrum'.  There are about a dozen half-sheets (2 elephants instead of 4).  The sheet numbering is somewhat erratic, with different `grids' north and south of the river, and with the transriparian sections left blank: a most unusual arrangement, to say the least.  There are very few sanitary features, and altogther the similarity to later mapping (such as Huyton or Oystermouth) is very marked.  This is very different from the contemporary `Board of Health' mapping.  Inside the box lid is a note of 1965, saying that it was made pursuant to powers in the Bath City Act of 1851 which authorise the making of a map, and that because of subsequent additions  there is `danger' in allowing `all and sundry to see it and perhaps jump to conclusions'!

Reference, in two volumes, (alphabetical and numerical) is at SOM RO DD/BT C/1531 3/4/1.  However, there is no evidence that these are in fact a rating survey; they have two lots of numbers, in red and black, and columns for Owner & description, occupier, culture and measure, but no provision for œ.s.d., and certainly nothing about rating.  This box also contains some tithe apportionment documents, and the map is more likely to be connnected with them than with rating.  The same box also has a rate book of 1836-9, which uses a pre-printed book `Published by authority of the Poor Law Commissioners', and this is probably the source of the presumed misidentification.  This box also contains two versions of a rate book of 1823, which has columns for Occupier, Proprietor, Description (field name, etc), Present State (land use), Measure (in a.r.p.), annual value and two rates columns, but no map-numbers!	03.03.1838	3*					M	X	T	118 x 53, 42 x 21, 52 x 68, 52 x 42, 52 x 81, 51 x 119, 52 x 115, 101 x 52, 94 x 45	UU	F				BW			N							X								Y	Y		Y	Y			A - fragmentary.

Thurston Ashford'.  Between `whole parish' and `surveyed' is a wash drawing of the church and an adjoining house, (which the map of the village shows not to be the parsonage).

Well preserved and  well worth photographing.  The whole thing was apparently prepared by Adams in 1817-19 and revised by Thurston in 1842, (notably the S.E. Rly: the scraping was very well done, but the discontinuous depiction of the railway points to insertion on an old map, rather than complete redrawing, and some replacement green tint is not well matched; some owners' names also scraped and replaced;  pink ownership divisions also point to reuse rather than redrawing), with revised index.  The index map uses `hedges' for farm boundaries, green tint for woodland, yellow sienna for roads, red for parish boundary, and pink infill with `earthworks' for the railway.  There are a few moats.  There are strange caterpillar-like things in the churchyard: bushes?
