The view included measurements of all the rooms, but few indications of their relationships, horizontally or vertically, and it does not seem possible to reconstruct a clear picture of the arrangement of the rooms within the house from it. The house was approached by an entry from Cheapside, 23 ft. (7.01 m.) by 6 ft. (1.83 m.) between 8A2 and 8A3.  Behind this was a shop with a counting-house, 28 ft. (8.53 m.) by 24 ft. (7.32 m.) and a warehouse measured in 3 parts, 19 ft. by 10 1/2 ft. (5.79 m. by 3.20 m.), 18 ft. by 12 ft. (5.49 m. by 3.66 m.), and 12 ft. by 10 ft. (3.66 m. by 3.05 m.). Under the shop and part of the warehouse were a cellar 27 ft. by 20 ft. (8.23 m. by 6.10 m.), and a second cellar 22 ft. by 11 ft. (6.71 m. by 3.35 m.), in which there was a great summer, rotten and decayed with wet. There was also a 'little vault in the wall' 5 ft. by 4 ft. (1.52 m. by 1.22 m.) possibly the vault for a privy. On the ground floor, N. of the warehouse, there were a passageway 13 ft. by 6 ft. (3.96 m. by 1.83 m.), a second passageway and staircase 14 ft. (4.27 m.) square, a yard and passage 15 ft. (4.57 m.) square, an entry into a backyard 18 ft. by 6 ft. (5.49 m. by 1.83 m.), and a backyard 13 ft. by 10 ft. (3.96 m. by 3.05 m.). The kitchen and chimney, 18 ft. by 17 ft. (5.49 m. by 5.18 m.) an old buttery 11 1/2 ft. by 10 ft. (3.51 m. by 3.05 m.), and another passageway 9 ft. by 4 ft. (2.74 m. by 1.22 m.) were probably also on the ground floor. A wainscoted parlour 19 1/2 ft. by 17 1/2 ft. (5.94 m. by 5.33 m.) may be identical with the 'low parlour towards Honey Lane' mentioned in the leases of 1606 and 1612, and was probably on the ground floor, as also may have been a chamber with a countinghouse 27 ft. (6.71 m.) square. The upper parts of the house are also difficult to interpret, as different parts probably extended to different heights, topped by leads or garrets accordingly. There were certainly some intermixtures with 8A2 and 8A3, where the first-floor accommodation of those extended over the ground-floor shop of 8A1. There may also have been an intermixture with 8A4, to the N. of that tenement, and the relationship with 8A5, formerly the mansion-house part of 8A1, was probably also complicated. The view of 1630 mentions a parlour above stairs wainscoted, 17 1/2 ft. by 16 ft. (5.33 m. by 4.88 m.), and a chamber wainscoted, 19 ft. by 16 ft. (5.79 m. by 4.88 m.): these may be the 'upper room adjacent to the church' and the chamber adjoining it, with a window to the yard, mentioned in the previous leases. There were also a passageway, 17 ft. by 7 ft. (5.18 m. by 2.13 m.); four chambers, 13 ft. by 12 ft. (3.96 m. by 3.66 m.), 12 ft, by 10 ft. (3.66 m. by 3.05 m.), 24 ft. by 17 ft. (7.32 m. by 5.18 m.), and 16 ft. by 15 ft. (4.88 m. by 4.57 m.); a 'dark chamber' 12 ft. by 7 ft. (3.66 m. by 2.13 m.); and a house of office 6 ft. by 4 1/2 ft. (1.83 m. by 1.37 m.). Not all these need have been on the same floor. There were 2 leads, 20 ft. by 16 1/2 ft. (6.10 m. by 5.03 m.) and 8 ft. by 3 ft. (2.44 m. by 910 mm.); 2 back rooms, probably on the same level or higher, 11 ft. by 7 ft. (3.35 m. by 2.13 m.) and 12 ft. by 8 ft. (3.66 m. by 2.44 m.); a garret 24 ft.

(5.49 m. by 3.51 m.), and a dark room at the stairs head 8 ft. by 5 1/2 ft. (2.44 m. by 1.68 m.) were said to be 'anciently belonging' to the Black Bull, lying over the kitchen and warehouse of the same; they were presently occupied with the adjacent tenement of Ralph Edmunds, tailor. This adjacent tenement evidently belonged to the Mercers', and was probably 8A4 or 8A5, though Edmunds is not otherwise known as an undertenant or occupant of either property. The company at first intended to reunite the 3 last-mentioned rooms with the Black Bull, but then decided that they could remain divided, so long as care was taken in letting the lesser tenement that no nuisance was caused to the great tenement. The lease granted to Pountis in 1630, for 21 years from 1633, required him to repair and support the cellar where the summer had rotted, and to respect the rights of Gilbert Harrison's tenement (8A4). A fine of £400 had been recommended but only £350 was asked, possibly because the 3 rooms had not been added; the old rent of £10 was continued.

(4.57 m.) square, an entry into a backyard 18 ft. by 6 ft. (5.49 m. by 1.83 m.), and a backyard 13 ft. by 10 ft. (3.96 m. by 3.05 m.). The kitchen and chimney, 18 ft. by 17 ft. (5.49 m. by 5.18 m.) an old buttery 11 1/2 ft. by 10 ft. (3.51 m. by 3.05 m.), and another passageway 9 ft. by 4 ft. (2.74 m. by 1.22 m.) were probably also on the ground floor. A wainscoted parlour 19 1/2 ft. by 17 1/2 ft. (5.94 m. by 5.33 m.) may be identical with the 'low parlour towards Honey Lane' mentioned in the leases of 1606 and 1612, and was probably on the ground floor, as also may have been a chamber with a countinghouse 27 ft. (6.71 m.) square. The upper parts of the house are also difficult to interpret, as different parts probably extended to different heights, topped by leads or garrets accordingly. There were certainly some intermixtures with 8A2 and 8A3, where the first-floor accommodation of those extended over the ground-floor shop of 8A1. There may also have been an intermixture with 8A4, to the N. of that tenement, and the relationship with 8A5, formerly the mansion-house part of 8A1, was probably also complicated. The view of 1630 mentions a parlour above stairs wainscoted, 17 1/2 ft. by 16 ft. (5.33 m. by 4.88 m.), and a chamber wainscoted, 19 ft. by 16 ft. (5.79 m. by 4.88 m.): these may be the 'upper room adjacent to the church' and the chamber adjoining it, with a window to the yard, mentioned in the previous leases. There were also a passageway, 17 ft. by 7 ft. (5.18 m. by 2.13 m.); four chambers, 13 ft. by 12 ft. (3.96 m. by 3.66 m.), 12 ft, by 10 ft. (3.66 m. by 3.05 m.), 24 ft. by 17 ft. (7.32 m. by 5.18 m.), and 16 ft. by 15 ft. (4.88 m. by 4.57 m.); a 'dark chamber' 12 ft. by 7 ft. (3.66 m. by 2.13 m.); and a house of office 6 ft. by 4 1/2 ft. (1.83 m. by 1.37 m.). Not all these need have been on the same floor. There were 2 leads, 20 ft. by 16 1/2 ft. (6.10 m. by 5.03 m.) and 8 ft. by 3 ft. (2.44 m. by 910 mm.); 2 back rooms, probably on the same level or higher, 11 ft. by 7 ft. (3.35 m. by 2.13 m.) and 12 ft. by 8 ft. (3.66 m. by 2.44 m.); a garret 24 ft. (7.32 m.) square; and an upper leads 16 ft. by 6 ft. (4.88 m. by 1.83 m.). In addition three rooms (a chamber 18 ft. by 14 ft. (5.49 m. by 4.27 m.), a room 18 ft. by 11 1/2 ft. (5.49 m. by 3.51 m.), and a dark room at the stairs head 8 ft. by 5 1/2 ft. (2.44 m. by 1.68 m.) were said to be 'anciently belonging' to the Black Bull, lying over the kitchen and warehouse of the same; they were presently occupied with the adjacent tenement of Ralph Edmunds, tailor. This adjacent tenement evidently belonged to the Mercers', and was probably 8A4 or 8A5, though Edmunds is not otherwise known as an undertenant or occupant of either property. The company at first intended to reunite the 3 last-mentioned rooms with the Black Bull, but then decided that they could remain divided, so long as care was taken in letting the lesser tenement that no nuisance was caused to the great tenement. The lease granted to Pountis in 1630, for 21 years from 1633, required him to repair and support the cellar where the summer had rotted, and to respect the rights of Gilbert Harrison's tenement (8A4). A fine of £400 had been recommended but only £350 was asked, possibly because the 3 rooms had not been added; the old rent of £10 was continued.

388	270	11/8A3	1	"In 1630, with 3 years still to come, John Pountis petitioned for a new lease, and the company had the tenement viewed and valued. The view included measurements of all the rooms, but few indications of their relationships, horizontally or vertically, and it does not seem possible to reconstruct a clear picture of the arrangement of the rooms within the house from it.

Behind this was a shop with a counting-house, 28 ft. (8.53 m.) by 24 ft. (7.32 m.) and a warehouse measured in 3 parts, 19 ft. by 10 1/2 ft. (5.79 m. by 3.20 m.), 18 ft. by 12 ft. (5.49 m. by 3.66 m.), and 12 ft. by 10 ft. (3.66 m. by 3.05 m.). Under the shop and part of the warehouse were a cellar 27 ft. by 20 ft. (8.23 m. by 6.10 m.), and a second cellar 22 ft. by 11 ft. (6.71 m. by 3.35 m.), in which there was a great summer, rotten and decayed with wet. There was also a 'little vault in the wall' 5 ft. by 4 ft. (1.52 m. by 1.22 m.) possibly the vault for a privy. On the ground floor, N. of the warehouse, there were a passageway 13 ft. by 6 ft. (3.96 m. by 1.83 m.), a second passageway and staircase 14 ft. (4.27 m.) square, a yard and passage 15 ft. (4.57 m.) square, an entry into a backyard 18 ft. by 6 ft. (5.49 m. by 1.83 m.), and a backyard 13 ft. by 10 ft. (3.96 m. by 3.05 m.). The kitchen and chimney, 18 ft. by 17 ft. (5.49 m. by 5.18 m.) an old buttery 11 1/2 ft. by 10 ft. (3.51 m. by 3.05 m.), and another passageway 9 ft. by 4 ft. (2.74 m. by 1.22 m.) were probably also on the ground floor. A wainscoted parlour 19 1/2 ft. by 17 1/2 ft. (5.94 m. by 5.33 m.) may be identical with the 'low parlour towards Honey Lane' mentioned in the leases of 1606 and 1612, and was probably on the ground floor, as also may have been a chamber with a countinghouse 27 ft. (6.71 m.) square. The upper parts of the house are also difficult to interpret, as different parts probably extended to different heights, topped by leads or garrets accordingly. There were certainly some intermixtures with 8A2 and 8A3, where the first-floor accommodation of those extended over the ground-floor shop of 8A1. There may also have been an intermixture with 8A4, to the N. of that tenement, and the relationship with 8A5, formerly the mansion-house part of 8A1, was probably also complicated. The view of 1630 mentions a parlour above stairs wainscoted, 17 1/2 ft. by 16 ft. (5.33 m. by 4.88 m.), and a chamber wainscoted, 19 ft. by 16 ft. (5.79 m. by 4.88 m.): these may be the 'upper room adjacent to the church' and the chamber adjoining it, with a window to the yard, mentioned in the previous leases. There were also a passageway, 17 ft. by 7 ft. (5.18 m. by 2.13 m.); four chambers, 13 ft. by 12 ft. (3.96 m. by 3.66 m.), 12 ft, by 10 ft. (3.66 m. by 3.05 m.), 24 ft. by 17 ft. (7.32 m. by 5.18 m.), and 16 ft. by 15 ft. (4.88 m. by 4.57 m.); a 'dark chamber' 12 ft. by 7 ft. (3.66 m. by 2.13 m.); and a house of office 6 ft. by 4 1/2 ft. (1.83 m. by 1.37 m.). Not all these need have been on the same floor. There were 2 leads, 20 ft. by 16 1/2 ft. (6.10 m. by 5.03 m.) and 8 ft. by 3 ft. (2.44 m. by 910 mm.); 2 back rooms, probably on the same level or higher, 11 ft. by 7 ft. (3.35 m. by 2.13 m.) and 12 ft. by 8 ft. (3.66 m. by 2.44 m.); a garret 24 ft. (7.32 m.) square; and an upper leads 16 ft. by 6 ft. (4.88 m. by 1.83 m.). In addition three rooms (a chamber 18 ft. by 14 ft. (5.49 m. by 4.27 m.), a room 18 ft. by 11 1/2 ft. (5.49 m. by 3.51 m.), and a dark room at the stairs head 8 ft. by 5 1/2 ft. (2.44 m. by 1.68 m.) were said to be 'anciently belonging' to the Black Bull, lying over the kitchen and warehouse of the same; they were presently occupied with the adjacent tenement of Ralph Edmunds, tailor. This adjacent tenement evidently belonged to the Mercers', and was probably 8A4 or 8A5, though Edmunds is not otherwise known as an undertenant or occupant of either property. The company at first intended to reunite the 3 last-mentioned rooms with the Black Bull, but then decided that they could remain divided, so long as care was taken in letting the lesser tenement that no nuisance was caused to the great tenement. The lease granted to Pountis in 1630, for 21 years from 1633, required him to repair and support the cellar where the summer had rotted, and to respect the rights of Gilbert Harrison's tenement (8A4). A fine of £400 had been recommended but only £350 was asked, possibly because the 3 rooms had not been added; the old rent of £10 was continued. The new lease contained a schedule as before"	1

(5.49 m. by 3.51 m.), and a dark room at the stairs head 8 ft. by 5 1/2 ft.

(1.83 m.) between 8A2 and 8A3.  Behind this was a shop with a counting-house, 28 ft. (8.53 m.) by 24 ft. (7.32 m.) and a warehouse measured in 3 parts, 19 ft. by 10 1/2 ft. (5.79 m. by 3.20 m.), 18 ft. by 12 ft. (5.49 m. by 3.66 m.), and 12 ft. by 10 ft. (3.66 m. by 3.05 m.). Under the shop and part of the warehouse were a cellar 27 ft. by 20 ft. (8.23 m. by 6.10 m.), and a second cellar 22 ft. by 11 ft. (6.71 m. by 3.35 m.), in which there was a great summer, rotten and decayed with wet. There was also a 'little vault in the wall' 5 ft. by 4 ft. (1.52 m. by 1.22 m.) possibly the vault for a privy. On the ground floor, N. of the warehouse, there were a passageway 13 ft. by 6 ft. (3.96 m. by 1.83 m.), a second passageway and staircase 14 ft. (4.27 m.) square, a yard and passage 15 ft. (4.57 m.) square, an entry into a backyard 18 ft. by 6 ft. (5.49 m. by 1.83 m.), and a backyard 13 ft. by 10 ft. (3.96 m. by 3.05 m.). The kitchen and chimney, 18 ft. by 17 ft. (5.49 m. by 5.18 m.) an old buttery 11 1/2 ft. by 10 ft. (3.51 m. by 3.05 m.), and another passageway 9 ft. by 4 ft. (2.74 m. by 1.22 m.) were probably also on the ground floor. A wainscoted parlour 19 1/2 ft. by 17 1/2 ft. (5.94 m. by 5.33 m.) may be identical with the 'low parlour towards Honey Lane' mentioned in the leases of 1606 and 1612, and was probably on the ground floor, as also may have been a chamber with a countinghouse 27 ft. (6.71 m.) square. The upper parts of the house are also difficult to interpret, as different parts probably extended to different heights, topped by leads or garrets accordingly. There were certainly some intermixtures with 8A2 and 8A3, where the first-floor accommodation of those extended over the ground-floor shop of 8A1. There may also have been an intermixture with 8A4, to the N. of that tenement, and the relationship with 8A5, formerly the mansion-house part of 8A1, was probably also complicated. The view of 1630 mentions a parlour above stairs wainscoted, 17 1/2 ft. by 16 ft. (5.33 m. by 4.88 m.), and a chamber wainscoted, 19 ft. by 16 ft. (5.79 m. by 4.88 m.): these may be the 'upper room adjacent to the church' and the chamber adjoining it, with a window to the yard, mentioned in the previous leases. There were also a passageway, 17 ft. by 7 ft. (5.18 m. by 2.13 m.); four chambers, 13 ft. by 12 ft. (3.96 m. by 3.66 m.), 12 ft, by 10 ft. (3.66 m. by 3.05 m.), 24 ft. by 17 ft. (7.32 m. by 5.18 m.), and 16 ft. by 15 ft. (4.88 m. by 4.57 m.); a 'dark chamber' 12 ft. by 7 ft. (3.66 m. by 2.13 m.); and a house of office 6 ft. by 4 1/2 ft. (1.83 m. by 1.37 m.). Not all these need have been on the same floor. There were 2 leads, 20 ft. by 16 1/2 ft. (6.10 m. by 5.03 m.) and 8 ft. by 3 ft. (2.44 m. by 910 mm.); 2 back rooms, probably on the same level or higher, 11 ft. by 7 ft. (3.35 m. by 2.13 m.) and 12 ft. by 8 ft. (3.66 m. by 2.44 m.); a garret 24 ft. (7.32 m.) square; and an upper leads 16 ft. by 6 ft. (4.88 m. by 1.83 m.). In addition three rooms (a chamber 18 ft. by 14 ft. (5.49 m. by 4.27 m.), a room 18 ft. by 11 1/2 ft. (5.49 m. by 3.51 m.), and a dark room at the stairs head 8 ft. by 5 1/2 ft.

There were also a passageway, 17 ft. by 7 ft. (5.18 m. by 2.13 m.); four chambers, 13 ft. by 12 ft. (3.96 m. by 3.66 m.), 12 ft, by 10 ft. (3.66 m. by 3.05 m.), 24 ft. by 17 ft.

Not all these need have been on the same floor. There were 2 leads, 20 ft. by 16 1/2 ft. (6.10 m. by 5.03 m.) and 8 ft. by 3 ft. (2.44 m. by 910 mm.); 2 back rooms, probably on the same level or higher, 11 ft. by 7 ft. (3.35 m. by 2.13 m.) and 12 ft. by 8 ft. (3.66 m. by 2.44 m.); a garret 24 ft.

"The rooms listed in Waldo's probate inventory seem to correspond fairly well with those named in the view of 1630, though some smaller rooms and passages cannot be correlated. There was a back warehouse, and a shop with countinghouse used for trade, with scales, presses and counters, drawers and a desk. A little room by the shop contained a bedstead but no furnishings, and a little room over the shop a trunk and chests.

There were 8 rooms with beds and bedding, including the leads chamber, the mens' chamber, the maids' chamber, the great chamber, the dark chamber, and the wainscot chamber. Waldo may have used the wainscot chamber, as his livery gown and clothes are listed under that head. There were also entries, passages and closets, a garret containing lumber, and a cellar containing wood, coal, a beer-still, and lumber.

Orientations N.-S. and E.-W. are not given in the view, but are inserted in the following description in parentheses, where the identification seems reasonably certain. For a reconstruction, see Figs. 1 and 4. The tenement comprised a cellar, ground floor, and 5 upper storeys, the latter extending E. over the entry to the Black Bull (8A1) behind, which was at ground level, and jettying forward over Cheapside. The cellar, 18ft. by 13 ft. (5.49 m. by 3.96 m.), must have extended under the entry to the Black Bull as well. The ground floor was 24 ft. (N.-S.) by 10 1/2 ft. (E.-W.) (7.32 m. by 3.20 m.), and was described as a shop and staircase. On the first floor was a hall, next to the street, 18 ft. (N.-S.) by 14 ft. (E.-W.) (5.49 m. by 4.27 m.), with a back room and staircase 8 1/2 ft. by 8 ft. (2.59 m. by 2.44 m.) behind, a passageway 8 ft. by 6 1.2 ft. (2.44 m. by 1.98 m.), and a 'yard above stairs leaded', measuring 14 ft. by 7 ft. (4.27 m. by 2.13 m.). This 'yard' was presumably over the shop or warehouse of the Black Bull. On the next floor was a chamber towards the street and over the hall, 16 ft. (N.-S.) by 14 ft. (E.-W.) (4.88 m. by 4.27 m.). wainscoted and with a closet, and behind it a kitchen and staircase 14 ft. by 13 ft. (4.27 m. by 3.96 m.), and a buttery 6 1/2 ft. (1.98 m.) square.

Orientations N.-S. and E.-W. are not given in the view, but are inserted in the following description in parentheses where the identification seems reasonably certain. The whole of the ground floor was a shop, 58 ft. 2 in. (17.73 m.) long (N.-S.) and 17 ft. (5.18 m.) wide at one end (the N.) and 14 ft. 8 in. (4.47 m.) at the other (S.). These dimensions correspond closely with the plot surveyed for the then tenant after the Fire: the narrower part, by the street, was some 21 ft. (6.40 m.) long (N.-S.) and the wider part nearly 37 ft. long (11.28 m.). Under the shop was a cellar near the street, 12 ft. 8 in. by 12 ft. (3.86 m. by 3.66 m.), and a cellar further back 22 ft. (N.-S.) by 15 ft. (E.-W.) (6.71 m. by 4.57 m.), presumably under the wider part of the shop; a little cellar with a staircase, 12 ft. 4 in. (E.-W.) by 9 ft. (N.-S.) (3.76 m. by 2.74 m.) probably linked the larger cellars and may have been the small cellar built by Harrison. The streetside range consisted on the first floor of a hall to the street, wainscoted, 14 ft. 8 in. (?E.-W.) by 14 ft. (?N.-S.) (4.47 m. by 4.27 m.) with 'a study and a carole window', probably to be interpreted as a bay or oriel window, measuring 8 1/2 ft. (?E.-W.) by 3 ft. (?N.-S.) (2.59 m. by 910mm). Behind the hall were a staircase and study, 12 ft. 8 in. by 10 ft. 8 in. (3.86 m. by 3.25 m.), and a paved kitchen, 17 ft. 4 in. (?E.-W.) by 12 ft. (?N.-S.) (5.28 m. by 3.66 m.). These must have extended some way back over the shop. Over the hall was a chamber with carved wainscot, 14 ft. 10 in. (?E.-W.) by 14 ft. 1 in. (4.52 m. by 4.29 m.) with a closet with 'carole' window 10 ft. by 2 1/2 ft., (3.05 m. by 760 mm.) and behind that a chamber and house of office, 15 1/2 ft. (?E.-W.) by 10 ft. (?N.-S.) (4.72 m. by 3.05 m.), and a staircase and passage 9 ft. 8 in. by 6 ft. (2.95 m. by 1.83 m.). On the third floor there was a wainscoted chamber next to the street, 14 1/2 ft. (?E.-W.) by 13 ft. 11 in. (?N.-S.) (4.42 m. by 4.24 m.), which also had a 'carole' window, 8 ft. by 2 ft. (2.44 m. by 610 mm.). Behind the chamber was another chamber with a staircase, 14 ft. (?E.-W.) by 12 ft. (?N.-S.) (4.27 m. by 3.66 m.), and behind that a 'flat forme' of lead 18 ft. by 7 ft. 4 in. (5.49 m. by 2.24 m.), probably over the rooms above the kitchen (see the lease of 1597). On the fourth floor were 2 chambers, both 15 ft. by 14 ft. (4.57 m. by 4.27 m.), probably corresponding to the rooms described as garrets in 1597, and above them a garret 30 ft. by 13 ft., (9.14 m. by 3.96 m.) probably the 'highest garret' of 1597. The front of the house was possibly not jettied in the usual way above the first floor - all the front rooms have very similar dimensions - but had this oriel window extending through 3 floors, and above it, on the 4th floor, a decorative feature of 'posts, flower, and reabus'.79"															
	"The arrangements at the back were more complex. There was an 'upper warehouse over Mr. Clapton's warehouse,' measuring 17 ft. by 14 ft. (5.18 m. by 4.27 m.), a little dining-room 'over the shop', 11 ft. by 9 ft. 4 in. (3.35 m. by 2.84 m.); a passage 23 1/2 ft. by 2 ft. 10 in. (7.16 m. by 860 mm.) leading to a back room 'over the said warehouse' measuring 17 ft. by 11 ft. 3 in. (5.18 m. by 3.43 m.); and another little room by it, 12 ft. by 8 ft. (3.66 m. by 2.44 m.); Edward Clapton held a shop parcel of 8A3 c. 1611, and possibly the warehouse referred to was over that, and therefore an intermixture between 8A3 and 8A4.80 It is also possible to suggest that 'Mr. Clapton's warehouse' was part of the ground-floor shop of 8A4, and also that the back room 'over the said warehouse' was actually over another part of the shop of 8A4, 'shop' and 'warehouse' being nearly synonymous terms for these large back rooms when used for commercial purposes. The dining room, the passage, and the back room were probably the rooms and entry over the shop beyond the kitchen, wainscoted by Harrison before 1627 and listed in his lease of that date. The ground floor shop can only have had window-lighting at the front, to Cheapside; the back part probably only had clerestories or rooflights. The back rooms of the street range from the second floor up would have had adequate light, but the kitchen might not have.81"																		
	"The messuage was valued at £400 for a 21-year lease in reversion at the old rent of £10, and a new lease was granted to Harrison, then chamberlain of London, on these terms in 1644.

"668 Bird claimed he had got Mr. Downer's or Mr. Pigeon's bill against him dismissed by order in Chancery, but the company was not yet satisfied. They did however state the terms for rebuilding they would offer to the confirmed tenant, namely a term made up to 51 years from 1668, at the old rent for the residue of the current lease and a new rent of £26 for the rest of the new term. Bird, presumably having got confirmation of his title, went to the Fire Court in October 1668, to obtain better terms. He referred to his loss of ground by the elimination of jetties and the loss of 4 rooms backward, possibly the intermixed rooms which Harrison had added to the tenement earlier. The company claimed that the ground was worth £30 p.a., and asked for an increase of rent or a fine. The Court decreed that on payment of £100 fine Bird should have a new lease of 60 years from 1668 at £10 rent, and should rebuild with all convenient speed.

Over the hall was a chamber with carved wainscot, 14 ft. 10 in. (?E.-W.) by 14 ft. 1 in. (4.52 m. by 4.29 m.) with a closet with 'carole' window 10 ft. by 2 1/2 ft., (3.05 m. by 760 mm.) and behind that a chamber and house of office, 15 1/2 ft. (?E.-W.) by 10 ft. (?N.-S.) (4.72 m. by 3.05 m.), and a staircase and passage 9 ft. 8 in. by 6 ft. (2.95 m. by 1.83 m.). On the third floor there was a wainscoted chamber next to the street, 14 1/2 ft. (?E.-W.) by 13 ft. 11 in. (?N.-S.) (4.42 m. by 4.24 m.), which also had a 'carole' window, 8 ft. by 2 ft. (2.44 m. by 610 mm.). Behind the chamber was another chamber with a staircase, 14 ft. (?E.-W.) by 12 ft. (?N.-S.) (4.27 m. by 3.66 m.), and behind that a 'flat forme' of lead 18 ft. by 7 ft. 4 in. (5.49 m. by 2.24 m.), probably over the rooms above the kitchen (see the lease of 1597). On the fourth floor were 2 chambers, both 15 ft. by 14 ft. (4.57 m. by 4.27 m.), probably corresponding to the rooms described as garrets in 1597, and above them a garret 30 ft. by 13 ft., (9.14 m. by 3.96 m.) probably the 'highest garret' of 1597. The front of the house was possibly not jettied in the usual way above the first floor - all the front rooms have very similar dimensions - but had this oriel window extending through 3 floors, and above it, on the 4th floor, a decorative feature of 'posts, flower, and reabus'.79"																						
	"The arrangements at the back were more complex. There was an 'upper warehouse over Mr. Clapton's warehouse,' measuring 17 ft. by 14 ft. (5.18 m. by 4.27 m.), a little dining-room 'over the shop', 11 ft. by 9 ft. 4 in. (3.35 m. by 2.84 m.); a passage 23 1/2 ft. by 2 ft. 10 in. (7.16 m. by 860 mm.) leading to a back room 'over the said warehouse' measuring 17 ft. by 11 ft. 3 in. (5.18 m. by 3.43 m.); and another little room by it, 12 ft. by 8 ft.

The dining room, the passage, and the back room were probably the rooms and entry over the shop beyond the kitchen, wainscoted by Harrison before 1627 and listed in his lease of that date.

" 1644, on Harrison's petition for a new lease, the company viewed and valued the tenement (see Figs. 1 and 4). It then comprised a streetside house of cellar, ground floor, and 5 upper stories, with a ground-floor shop occupying a large area behind, and some upper rooms possibly still further back. Orientations N.-S. and E.-W. are not given in the view, but are inserted in the following description in parentheses where the identification seems reasonably certain. The whole of the ground floor was a shop, 58 ft. 2 in. (17.73 m.) long (N.-S.) and 17 ft. (5.18 m.) wide at one end (the N.) and 14 ft. 8 in. (4.47 m.) at the other (S.). These dimensions correspond closely with the plot surveyed for the then tenant after the Fire: the narrower part, by the street, was some 21 ft. (6.40 m.) long (N.-S.) and the wider part nearly 37 ft. long (11.28 m.). Under the shop was a cellar near the street, 12 ft. 8 in. by 12 ft. (3.86 m. by 3.66 m.), and a cellar further back 22 ft. (N.-S.) by 15 ft. (E.-W.) (6.71 m. by 4.57 m.), presumably under the wider part of the shop; a little cellar with a staircase, 12 ft. 4 in. (E.-W.) by 9 ft. (N.-S.) (3.76 m. by 2.74 m.) probably linked the larger cellars and may have been the small cellar built by Harrison. The streetside range consisted on the first floor of a hall to the street, wainscoted, 14 ft. 8 in. (?E.-W.) by 14 ft. (?N.-S.) (4.47 m. by 4.27 m.) with 'a study and a carole window', probably to be interpreted as a bay or oriel window, measuring 8 1/2 ft. (?E.-W.) by 3 ft. (?N.-S.) (2.59 m. by 910mm). Behind the hall were a staircase and study, 12 ft. 8 in. by 10 ft. 8 in. (3.86 m. by 3.25 m.), and a paved kitchen, 17 ft. 4 in. (?E.-W.) by 12 ft. (?N.-S.) (5.28 m. by 3.66 m.). These must have extended some way back over the shop. Over the hall was a chamber with carved wainscot, 14 ft. 10 in. (?E.-W.) by 14 ft. 1 in. (4.52 m. by 4.29 m.) with a closet with 'carole' window 10 ft. by 2 1/2 ft., (3.05 m. by 760 mm.) and behind that a chamber and house of office, 15 1/2 ft. (?E.-W.) by 10 ft. (?N.-S.) (4.72 m. by 3.05 m.), and a staircase and passage 9 ft. 8 in. by 6 ft. (2.95 m. by 1.83 m.). On the third floor there was a wainscoted chamber next to the street, 14 1/2 ft. (?E.-W.) by 13 ft. 11 in. (?N.-S.) (4.42 m. by 4.24 m.), which also had a 'carole' window, 8 ft. by 2 ft. (2.44 m. by 610 mm.). Behind the chamber was another chamber with a staircase, 14 ft. (?E.-W.) by 12 ft. (?N.-S.) (4.27 m. by 3.66 m.), and behind that a 'flat forme' of lead 18 ft. by 7 ft. 4 in. (5.49 m. by 2.24 m.), probably over the rooms above the kitchen (see the lease of 1597). On the fourth floor were 2 chambers, both 15 ft. by 14 ft. (4.57 m. by 4.27 m.), probably corresponding to the rooms described as garrets in 1597, and above them a garret 30 ft. by 13 ft., (9.14 m. by 3.96 m.) probably the 'highest garret' of 1597. The front of the house was possibly not jettied in the usual way above the first floor - all the front rooms have very similar dimensions - but had this oriel window extending through 3 floors, and above it, on the 4th floor, a decorative feature of 'posts, flower, and reabus'.79"

	"The messuage was valued at £400 for a 21-year lease in reversion at the old rent of £10, and a new lease was granted to Harrison, then chamberlain of London, on these terms in 1644. This may have been changed to a 31-year term for a fine of £300 later in the year."	1

(6.10 m. by 4.57 m.) was now described as a low room used for a kitchen, 20 ft. long by 8 ft. wide (6.10 m. by 2.44 m.) in one part and 11 ft. (3.35 m.) wide in another; an entry 17 ft. by 3 1/2 ft. (5.18 m. by 1.07 m.) and a buttery 5 1/2 ft. by 3 1/2 ft. (1.68 m. by 1.07 m.) probably also came within the dimensions given in 1626. A room at the stairs' head with staircase and window, 13 ft. by 10 1/2 ft. (3.96 m. by 3.20 m.), was probably identical with the passage 14 ft. by 12 ft. (4.27 m. by 3.66 m.) of 1626. There were a house of office 6 ft. by 4 ft. (1.83 m. by 1.22 m.), two coalhouses 7 1/2 ft. by 5 1/2 ft. (2.29 m. by 1.68 m.) and 6 1/2 ft. by 5 ft. (1.98 m. by 1.52 m.), and another buttery 6 ft. by 3 ft. (1.83 m. by 910 mm.). There were four chambers, 16 ft. by 14 ft. (4.88 m. by 4.27 m.), 17 ft. by 10 1/2 ft. (5.18 m. by 3.20 m.), 17 ft. by 14 1/2 (5.18 m. by 4.42 m.) and 21 ft. by 15 ft. (6.40 m. by 4.57 m.) which probably corresponded with the four chambers mentioned in 1626, though the measurements vary slightly; the fourth chamber, the largest, included a countinghouse. The garret over Hamond's house had been transferred to that and was no longer listed, and the other garret, formerly 23 ft. by 16 ft. (7.01 m. by 4.88 m.), had been divided into 2 garrets 16 ft. by 10 1/2 ft. (4.88 m. by 3.20 m.) and 16 ft. by 11 ft. (4.88 m. by 3.35 m.). The company valued the tenement at £40 fine and £4 rent for a 21-year lease in reversion, and granted William Dawe a 23- year lease from 1632 for that fine and rent.89"																				
	"The other part of the tenement was granted to Thomas Heaton, the company's beadle, and held by him rent-free. The company was responsible for repairs, and in 1626-7 spent £53. 15s. 3d. on what must have been major repairs. Probably this included the £20 charged to Warner for repairs done to his house at the same time."	1		"Another view was taken of the tenement in 1630, which differs in some details from that of 1626, and also in that the measurements vary in some cases by502"	409	11/8A5	1	"Richard Hatton was in occupation of the part on lease to Dawe in 1652, when he petitioned for a new lease of that part and for a lease of the part formerly in the custody of Thomas Heaton.

Other petitioners for the lease of Heaton's part were William Davis and his wife Beatrice, Anne Tench, widow, and Thomas Carpenter. Both parts of the tenement were viewed, and the company decided to grant Hatton a new lease of both parts, on his surrender of the lease of the part he occupied, for 23 1/2 years from Michaelmas 1652, at £6 rent and £100 fine, payable half at Michaelmas and half at Lady Day 1655, provided he reunited the tenement and kept it so.
