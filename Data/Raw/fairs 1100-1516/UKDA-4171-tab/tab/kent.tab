In 1164, K Hen II assigned 40m. of his rent from Hoo to Reading abbey. In 1205, Robert Bardulf gave to the abbey lands in the manor of Hoo from which the 40m. were due. These lands lay in the parishes of All Hallows, St Mary and St Werburgh. All Hallows and St Mary were chapels dependant on St Werburgh. Reading abbey's main estate in Hoo was at Windhill close to Allhallows. Later in the thirteenth century, Robert Bardulf's lands at Hoo which he had not given to Reading were in the hands of the Poynz and Grey families. (B.R.
