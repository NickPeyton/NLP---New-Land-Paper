The name Winchelsea is first recorded early in the twelfth century. The place soon became a busy port and town, which was destroyed by incursions of the sea between 1250 and 1288. The precise site is uncertain: the grid reference denotes a place on the modern coast east of Winchelsea and SSE of Rye (cf. W.D. Cooper, 'The History of Winchelsea', (London, 1850), p. 1), but the site of the settlement may be further out to sea. The liberties of Old Winchelsea, presumably including a market and perhaps also a fair, passed to New Winchelsea, Sussex, the site of which was laid in 1283. The new town acquired the liberties of Old Winchelsea, presumably including the market held by the men of Winchelsea and perhaps also a fair. New Winchelsea went into decline as a result of French raids and the silting up of the estuary in the fourteenth century.
