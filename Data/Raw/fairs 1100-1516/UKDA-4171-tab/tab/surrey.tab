(VCH Surrey, iv, pp. 140) By the 1270s this market at St Thomas's Hospital was one of two markets in Southwark. Both may have developed out of the twelfth century corn market at the hospital, which was then situated within the precinct of Southwark priory, near London Bridge. After 1212, the hospital moved and the market associated with it was established at its new gate at Trenet Lane, within the manor of the archbp of Canterbury. It was recorded in 1295 and 1387 and was held on three days each week: Wed, Fri and Sat. The market declined in the late fifteenth century due to the competition from the Guildable manor market; in 1504 it was said to have been discontinued, but it was operating in 1522. (M. Carlin, 'Medieval Southwark' (London, 1996), p. 201) In 1275, certain tolls in an unspecified number of markets in the borough of Southwark were due to the earl of Surrey.
