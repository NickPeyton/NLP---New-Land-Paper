John denied the injury to Ralf's fair and stated that his father set up the Shepton Beauchamp fair by grant of the king, producing the charter. John stated that Ralf did not have a fair at White Lackington, but that there was a chapel of St Petroc there to which countrymen come every year on the feast day of the chapel with offerings. There was no other fair there except the assembly of countrymen coming there at the feast to make their pilgrimage. However, Ralf stated that all of his ancestors since the Conquest of England and before were used to have a fair at White Lackington on vf Petroc, until Robert de Beauchamp set up his fair at Shepton Beauchamp.

When Ralf was asked if he had any warrant for his fair or if he could show that he had the fair by grant of any king and said that he had no warrant except the length of his seisin. As John produced a charter of the king by which warrant he held his fair at Shepton Beauchamp and because Ralf could not prove that he had a fair at White Lackington by the grant of any king, nor could he produce any warrant by which he should be able to suppress John's fair, John went without a day and Ralf was in mercy.

John denied the injury to Ralf's fair and stated that his father set up the Shepton Beauchamp fair by grant of the king, producing the charter.

There was no other fair there except the assembly of countrymen coming there at the feast to make their pilgrimage. However, Ralf stated that all of his ancestors since the Conquest of England and before were used to have a fair at White Lackington on vf Petroc, until Robert de Beauchamp set up his fair at Shepton Beauchamp. John asked whether, as he had his fair by royal charter, he was bound to answer to Ralf concerning harm done to any fair for which he did not show warrant and could not prove that he had the fair by grant of any king of England. When Ralf was asked if he had any warrant for his fair or if he could show that he had the fair by grant of any king and said that he had no warrant except the length of his seisin. As John produced a charter of the king by which warrant he held his fair at Shepton Beauchamp and because Ralf could not prove that he had a fair at White Lackington by the grant of any king, nor could he produce any warrant by which he should be able to suppress John's fair, John went without a day and Ralf was in mercy.
