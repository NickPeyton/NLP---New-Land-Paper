The town and the fair are usually recorded together in the early references, suggesting that the fair was influential in the success of the settlement. In 1241, K Hen III granted the honor of Richmond (one of the most important in medieval England) including Boston, to Peter de Savoy, the uncle of the queen. However, on the latter's death in 1268, it was restored to John of Brittany. Boston was incorporated in 1545. (P.

(RLC, i, p. 499b) In 1280, the fair brought in £289 in gross receipts. By the late thirteenth century, the fair was apparently held later in the year, in Aug and Sept. In 1331, the length of the fair was found to vary: it was usually held from St Botolph's day (17 Jun) until the feast of Bartholomew (24 Aug), but sometimes lasted until the Exaltation of Holy Cross (14 Sept) or even until Michaelmas (29 Sept). (E.W. Moore, 'The Fairs of Medieval England, an Introductory Study', (Toronto, 1985), pp. 15-17) However, by 1350 the fair had declined considerably and it was no longer a trading point of international significance. The decline of the port and town was less rapid. Over the fourteenth century, by measures of wealth and population, Boston fell from about fifth to about tenth amongst English towns. By the sixteenth century it had fallen to twenty-sixth, or lower."

Fulcon gave 1m. for having the market just as it was then 'ad festum sancti Michaelis in 1 mensem', i.e. on Sunday 27 October 1202, a phrase suggesting that this 'market' was in fact an annual fair or that the change to the new market day was to take place after 1202. (D.M. Stenton ed.,'The Earliest Lincolnshire Assize Rolls, 1202-09', Lincolnshire Record Society, xxii, (1926), no. 902) 1203, Nova Oblata: Fulco de Oyri paid 30m. and one palfrey worth 10m., for having a market and a fair (see below).

(RLC, i, p. 20) This suggests that the market established in 1202 was not in fact that from Fleet, transferred here, but an extra market. On 20 Mar 1227, K Hen III granted Fulk Oyry a Sat market at Gedney. (CChR, 1226-57, p. 28) A letter to the sh of Lincolnshire regarding the Sat market, dated 22 Mar 1227, suggests that the change of market day from Sat ordered in 1205 may not have been put into effect. (RLC, ii, p. 178) In 1281, Peter de Gonsele, with Simon le Cunstable and Walter le Burgyllon claimed a Sat market and all that pertained to the market of old in Holbeach and Whapplode, Lincolnshire (q.v.). As Walter was under age and in the king's custody, Peter was not able to answer.

98	SWINDERBY 	LINCOLNSHIRE	England	4869	3632					42.59	"On 6 Jul 1345, it was stated that K Edw III had heard that 'diverse felonies and robberies' had occurred on the Fosse highway between the city of Lincoln, Lincolnshire and the town of Newark, Nottinghamshire (q.v.), because there was no town nearby and no men living there. The P of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England had requested that 'for the greater safety of travellers there and the repressing of ill-doing', he could build a town or hamlet and settle men on his land at a place called Swinderby Moor, adjacent to the Fosse way and at his manor of 'Aycle', this being the 'chief resort' of the felons. K Edw III therefore gave the P licence to refound a chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity, to build a town and houses around it and to enclose plots (placeas) and grant them to men ready to move there for the 'entertainment' of travellers. The P and his successors were to hold the chapel and its associated settlement. In conjunction with this, the king granted the P the market and two fairs below. Just over one hundred years later, on 26 Jun 1449, Robert Botyll, P of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England, restored this charter into the chancery to be cancelled as far as the market and fairs were concerned. K Hen VI then granted Robert a market and two fairs in the town of Swinderby pertaining to the manor of 'Aycle', 'which town is not distant more than a quarter of a mile from the place called Swynderby Moor'. At the same time, the king granted Robert licence to embattle, crenellate and machicolate the manor, the right to impark a large area of wood and pasture and also the right to free warren. (CChR, 1341-1417, pp. 40-1; CChR, 1427-1516, pp. 112-13) The market and fairs held at Swinderby Moor were the same as those later held at Swinderby. Swinderby lies about half a mile from the Fosse Way and Swinderby Moor, the exact site of which is not known, was probably on the Fosse Way itself.
