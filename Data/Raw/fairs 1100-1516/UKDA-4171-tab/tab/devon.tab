A fair held by William de Helion, which had eschaeted to the Crown in 1163-4, was recorded in 1196-1203 and 1220-1. There is no record of the feast on which it was held. (PR, 10 Hen II, p. 19; PR, 11 Hen II, p. 79; PR, 14 Hen II, p. 125; PR, 15 Hen II, p. 48; PR, 16 Hen II, p. 97; PR, 17 Hen II, p. 25; PR, 18 Hen II p. 98; PR, 19 Hen II, p. 143; PR, 20 Hen II, p. 89; PR, 21 Hen II, p. 59; Chancellor's Roll, 8 Ric I, p. 143; PR, 9 Ric I, p. 4; PR, 10 Ric I, p. 177; PR, 1 John, p. 188; PR, 2 John, p. 225; PR, 3 John, p. 216; PR, 4 John, p. 245; PR, 5 John, p. 72; PR, 4 Hen III, p. 82; PR, 5 Hen III, p. 66) This pattern of royal income, with a break between 1203 and 1219, indicates that the fair was the one mentioned on 5 May 1204, when K John granted the city of Exeter and its fair to Qu Isabel. (RCh, p. 128) The city of Exeter and its fair were on 1 Nov 1216 (immediately after the death of K John) to be given to Qu Isabel as part of her dower. (RLC, i, p. 293) However, from 1220, when Qu Isabel married Hugh de Lusignan, the English government withheld her dower, although in 1224 it compensated her for the income she had not received. (D.A. Carpenter, 'The Minority of Henry III', (Berkeley, 1990), pp. 193, 221, 267, 345) On 19 Jul 1225, K Hen III granted the P and M of St Nicholas of Exeter the fair which Qu Isabel, the king's mother, had given them. (RLC, ii, p. 51) On 20 Jul 1227 (shortly after he declared his majority), K Hen III granted a fair at Exeter to the P and M of St Nicholas, Exeter, as they were accustomed to have it by the grant of Qu I[sabel], the king's mother. (RLC, ii, p. 193) None of these sources specify the feast of the fair, but since the Lammas fair was the only one that St Nicholas's priory ever claimed, there can be little doubt that these grants concerned the Lammas fair. In 1274-5, the citizens of Exeter claimed that they had once held the fair. They continued unsuccessfully to assert their claim in the fourteenth century. Fair survived into the sixteenth century.

The settlement contained two parts: a narrow coastal strip (originally part of Dawlish) which contained the church of St Michael and the saltpans mentioned in a charter of 1044, which became East Teignmouth; immediately adjoining to the west across the narrow river Tame was the part of the settlement which came to be known as West Teignmouth, Devon (q.v.). (W.C. Lake, 'Ancient Teignmouth', Transactions of the Devonshire Association, 36, (1904), pp. 101-12 and Transactions of the Devonshire Association 13 (1881), pp. 108-17; P.H. Sawyer, 'Anglo-Saxon Charters: an annotated list and bibliography', Royal Historical Society (London, 1968), no. 1003) The two parts of the settlement seem not to have been distinguished by name until the 1280s. (J.E.B. Gover, A. Mawer and F.M. Stenton eds., 'The Place-Names of Devon', (Cambridge, 1932), ii, p. 503) In the 1334 Lay Subsidy, East Teignmouth was assessed with Dawlish at ˙43.50. (Glasscock, p. 59) In the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, Teignmouth was a small but important port. It was damaged in 1340 and never recovered its former position. (Kowaleski, 'Local Markets', pp. 32, 241) The two parts of Teignmouth probably functioned as a single urban settlement. East Teignmouth is first unambiguously recorded as a borough in 1311, but in a record of 1275-6 seems to be regarded as part of the borough 'on St Michael's side' which belonged to the dean and chapter of Exeter, whilst the west part of the borough belonged to the bp of Exeter.

In 1275-6, it was stated in a record whose meaning is not entirely clear that the bp of Exeter (presumably acting as lord of West Teignmouth and / or Bishopsteigton, Devon (q.v.)) had held a market on Sat through the year up to the last feast of St Michael for seven years without warrant and that the market ought to have been 'in burgo de Tengemue ex parte Beati Michaelis' (i.e. on St Michael's side of the borough) belonging to the dean and chapter of Exeter. (RH, i, p. 89) This probably means that the bp had shifted the market into West Teignmouth, which was under his control, or held a rival Sat market there. The problem appears to have continued for in Michaelmas 1282 a sh of an unamed county was ordered to prevent the men of 'Westtengemuth' from any longer holding a market at 'Tenthemuth' on Sat.
