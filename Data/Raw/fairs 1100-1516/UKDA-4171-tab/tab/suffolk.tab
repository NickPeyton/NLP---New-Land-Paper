There was a vigorous small town here in 1086, enlarged and reshaped since 1066. (Little Domesday, fo. 372) The name 'seynt Eadmundes biri' does not necessarily indicate the existence of a town by 1043 (cf. BF, p. 165). In 1102-3, K Hen I confirmed the monastery and burgesses in the liberty they enjoyed under K Cnut and K Edw the Confessor, indicating a belief that there had been a town there by 1035. The single moneyer active at Bury c.1048-c.1065 was not very productive and probably indicates the status of the abbey rather than market activity, which perhaps took off in the 1060s. The market is later recorded as being in existence by 1087. Town enlarged in the twelfth century, in conjunction with the building of the new abbey ch. In 1202, the A of St Edmunds paid 40m. and 10m. for two palfreys for a royal charter by which no markets or fairs would be established in the liberty of St Edmunds that would damage his liberty. (D.
