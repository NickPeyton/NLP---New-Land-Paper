None of the records of Hugh's debt identify the location of his market within Berkshire. There is only one reference to Hugh de Nevill in the index of VCH Berkshire, which notes that at the beginning of the thirteenth century he held an estate called Benham, lately held by Hugh Wake. (VCH Berkshire, iv, p. 104) King John granted Hugh de Nevill the lands and the heir of Hugh Wake on 14 Oct 1199; presumably this included Benham. (RCh, p. 27) Hugh de Nevill was holding the Benham estate in 1210 and 1212. It subsequently passed back to the Wake family until 1251, when it was granted to William de Valence. Henceforth the estate became known as Benham Valence. (VCH Berkshire, iv, p. 102) VCH does not record the grant of the market and provides no further evidence for trading taking place on this estate. However, there is no other evidence for Hugh's holdings within the county and a strong correlation between the date on which he was granted Benham and the first evidence of the grant of the market. It therefore seems likely that Hugh's market was to be held at the Benham estate. As there is no subsequent evidence for the market, it is possible that it was not set up, or that it failed to thrive due to the proximity of nearby markets such as Hungerford and Newbury, Berkshire (q.v.)."
