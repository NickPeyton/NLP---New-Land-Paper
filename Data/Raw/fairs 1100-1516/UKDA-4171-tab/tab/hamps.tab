49	"NEWTOWN, ISLE OF WIGHT"	HAMPSHIRE	England	4422	907	Y	1254-5	"BF, p. 119"			"The borough of Newtown was established by Aymer, bp-elect of Winchester in 1254-5, when it was described as 'new' in the bp's account roll. Newtown was created within the bp's manor of Calbourne (also called Swainston after the site of the episcopal manor house built c.1180) and was also known as Swainston borough or as Francheville ('free town'). Newtown was situated where the Caul Bourne and other small watercourses entered an inlet of the the Solent. In 1256, Bp Aymer issued a charter granting the burgesses of Newtown the same liberties as the bp's burgesses of Taunton, Somerset; Alresford, Hampshire; Witney, Oxfordshire and Farnham, Surrey. Newtown was a successful port. It was surrendered by the bp of Winchester to K Edw I in 1284. The following year, the king confimed the burgesses' privileges. Newtown went into decline following French raids in the late fourteenth century and as a result of competition from Yarmouth and Southampton, Hampshire (q.v.). In 1674, only eleven houses were recorded at Newtown. (M. Beresford, 'The six new towns of the bishop of Winchester, 1200-55', 'Medieval Archaeology', 3, (1959), pp. 202-13; VCH Hampshire, v, pp. 265, 267) It is possible that the creation of the borough of Newtown was a second attempt by a bp of Winchester to establish an urban centre in the area. On 19 Jul 1215, the sh of Hampshire was instructed that K John had granted P[eter des Roches] bp of Winchester, a Wed market in his manor of 'Scauburn'. The sh was ordered to cause the bp to have the market, according to the form of the letters patent. (RLC, i, p. 221) These letters patent have not been found during the compilation of the Gazetteer. The location of 'Scauburn' is not known. However, it seems likely that it had the same origin as the Caul Bourne, discussed above. (see S.F. Hockey, 'Quarr Abbey and its Lands, 1132-1631', (Leicester, 1970), pp. 40-2; S.F. Hockey, 'The Charters of Quarr Abbey', (Isle of Wight County Record Office, 1991); A.D. Mills, 'The Place-Names of the Isle of Wight', (Stamford, 1996), p. 93) Nothing further is known of the market at 'Scauburn'. It is not mentioned by either Beresford or VCH.

The medieval street system was probably laid out in the late ninth century. High Street, the principal trading street was known c.900 as 'market street'. Between 1066 and c.1110, a market was established on what had been a private site in High Street, probably by throwing the land open to the street. There were also market areas just inside and just outside some of the city gates. From the twelfth century a large market area was established to the south of High Street in the cathedral cemetery, on parts of the sites of the former royal palace and New Minster. In 1349, following the pressure on burial space during the Black Death, this trading area was much reduced and a wall was constructed to divide the cemetery from the market place. On 15 Jul 1449, the mayor bailiffs and citizens of Winchester were holding markets on Fri and Sun, which were said to have been held within the city from time immemorial. They wanted to abandon the Fri and Sun markets and were granted a Sat market in lieu.(CChR, 1424- 1516, p. 113) In the fourteenth century and earlier, markets had probably been held more often, perhaps on the days the city court met (Mon, Wed and Fri c.1300) as well as others. (J.S. Furley, 'City Government of Winchester', (Oxford, 1923), p. 134) After the creation of the bp's soke during the thirteenth century, there were probably lesser local markets in those parts of the suburbs which were under the bp's control, but little is known of them.

(Regesta, i, no. 377) The fair quickly became one of the major international fairs of England and the only one in the first rank south of the Thames. It suffered a sharp loss of business in the late thirteenth century and was insignificant after 1400. In 1110, K Hen I extended the length of St Giles' fair by 5 days, giving an eight day fair. (Regesta, ii, nos. 947, 949) This charter was inspected and confirmed by K Edw II on 10 Jun 1317. (CChR, 1300-26, p. 346) In 1114, K Hen I reiterated this grant. (Regesta, ii, no. 1070) In 1234-5, the citizens of Winchester complained about the disturbance caused by the sixteen day fair held by the bp of Winchester on St Giles's hill.

On 4 Jul 1317, K Edw II inspected and confirmed this charter. (CChR, 1300-26, p. 352) In Mar 1155, K Hen II, ignoring K Steph's grant, doubled the number of days from 8 to 16, in a grant confirmed by K Ric I on 8 Sept 1198 (CChR, 1300-26, p. 356) On 4 Jul 1317, K Edw II inspected and confirmed K Ric I's charter. (CChR, 1300-26, p. 356) On 26 Dec 1199, K John confirmed the extension of the fair from 8 days to 16 days.

(CR, 1256-9, p. 430) On 13 Sept 1260, the custodian of Winchester was ordered to proclaim this again. (CR, 1259-61, p. 114) On 7 Sept 1261, K Hen III repeated this mandate. He also ordered that by his special grace merchants were allowed to sell their wares in the city of Winchester from the Sun after the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (14 Sept). (CR, 1259-61, pp. 436-7) In the late thirteenth century it appears to have been normal practice for merchants to descend on the city on 15 Sept, where the fair continued to the end of the month. (D. Keene, 'Survey of Medieval Winchester', (Oxford, 1985), ii, p. 1114) On 5 Jun 1284, K Edw I quitclaimed to John, bp of Winchester, all of his right in the fair of St Giles.
