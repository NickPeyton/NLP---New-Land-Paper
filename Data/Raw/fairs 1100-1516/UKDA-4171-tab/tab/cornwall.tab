After the Norman Conquest, the count of Mortain built a castle on the hill at Dunheved across the river from the old town, to which the name Launceston was transferred. This castle became the focus of a new town, called Launceston. It is assumed that when the Normans revived the mint which had been situated at St Stephens, it was moved across to Launceston. Launceston priory was moved from St Stephens to the Launceston side of the river in 1155. Launceston was represented by its own jury at the eyre of 1201, inferring borough status. In 1227x42, it was made a free borough by Richard, earl of Cornwall, who granted the burgesses land on which to build a guildhall. In the later middle ages, a suburb known as Newport developed back across the river towards St Stephens. By 1529, Newport was a parliamentary borough.

After the Conquest, the focus of economic activity shifted across the river to the present site of Launceston, which grew up around the castle established by the count of Mortain. A mint had been established here in the Anglo-Saxon period. It is presumed that when the mint was revived by the Normans, it was also moved across to the new settlement. The college of priests at St Stephens was converted into a priory of regular canons in the 1120s. In 1155, Launceston priory was moved across the river to Launceston. The value from the 1334 Lay Subsidy relates to St Stephen's by Launceston, which was taxed at a fifteenth. (Beresford, p. 405; Glasscock, p. 34; P.L.
