Traditionally, the site was settled c.995 by the community of St Cuthbert. It subsequently became one of the most important centres of pilgrimage in England. See of the bishopric was transferred from Chester-le-Street, Durham (q.v.) to Durham in 990. The city was administrative centre of the largely autonomous region that the bps controlled and its principal market town. By 1200 there were four boroughs at Durham. The Bishop's borough (also known as the borough of Durham), was held by the bp. The burgesses of the borough of Durham are first recorded in 1130; in c.1179, Bp Hugh du Puiset granted them the free customs of Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland (q.v.). The three other boroughs were first recorded in the twelfth century. Old Borough (also called Crossgate) was held by Durham priory. The borough of Elvet (or New Elvet) was developed by Bp Puisset but granted to the priory; the burgesses of the new borough of Elvethalge were granted a charter by Prior Bertram and the convent in 1188x1219. The fourth borough, that of St Giles, first recorded in c.1180, was originally held by the bp, who granted it to Kepier hospital. Whilst these boroughs were physically separate when established, they subsequently developed and merged together. Only the bp's borough had a market; the other three were unusual boroughs, in that they did not have markets. (M.
