A complex system of street markets evolved, with numerous specialised sites. The principal business street, Cheapside ('forum', 'Ceap', 'Chepe') is recorded by the twelfth century, but probably originated in the late ninth; Eastcheap is recorded by c.1100. (E.

In the tenth century, the abbey acquired the land extending up to the City of London, formerly occupied by the commercial settlement of London. The City of London subsequently absorbed the eastern part of that land. The abbey had a market and several fairs held at the abbey. The hospital of St James' had a fair held near Charing Cross. In the 1334 lay subsidy, Westminster was valued with St Mary in the Strand, St Martin in the Fields and St Clement Danes at ú160.22.
