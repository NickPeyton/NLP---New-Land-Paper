They stated that the market at St Ives would prevent ships coming to Huntingdon. The market at St Ives was also alleged to be damaging the market at Yaxley, Huntingdonshire (q.v.), held by the A of Thorney who claimed that the traffic in ships going to St Ives was so great that they would not dock at Yaxley on Thurs, the day of its market. The men of the A of Ramsey stated that as there was as much traffic by land as by sea, the St Ives market could not be damaging that at Yaxley. (CRR, xiii, no. 386) There is no record of a decision in this legal case. It is possible that the A of Ramsey lost his right to hold a market at St Ives, until a new market was granted by charter in 1292 (see below)."

(Regesta, ii, no. 1585) In 1135, K Hen I granted the A and M of Ramsey and St Ives a fair from Mon in Easter week to Mon next. (Regesta, ii, no. 1916) On 14 Jun 1170 x Nov 1171, Henry the Young King ordered the sh, bailiffs and reeves of Huntingdon to allow Ramsey abbey to have its rights in the fair of St Ives. (R.J. Smith, 'Henry II's heir: the Acta and seal of Henry the Young King, 1170-83', English Historical Review, 116 (2001), no. 28) The fair was mentioned in 1198. (PR, 10 Ric I, p. 161) On 22 Oct 1200, K John confirmed the fair held by the A, ch and M of Ramsey at St Ivo de Slepe and the hundred and a half of Clacklose. (RCh, p. 76) By the early thirteenth century, this was one of the major fairs of England, generating an income of ú101 in 1207 and ú180 in 1212. (E.W. Moore, 'The Fairs of Medieval England, an Introductory Study', (Toronto, 1985), p. 14) Fair referred to in 1207, 1210 and 1211; fair at St Ives on 15 Apr noted in 1222. (PR, 9 John, pp. 110-11; PR, 12 John, p. 215; PR, 13 John, p. 207; CRR, x, p. 338) An unspecified number of fairs, the feasts of which were not given, were operating in Apr 1225. (RLC, ii, pp. 24, 70) In 1227, the burgesses of Huntingdon complained that the A of Ramsey's fair was damaging the town of Huntingdon, Huntingdonshire (q.v.). (CRR, xiii, no. 386) On 17 Apr 1227, K Hen III ordered the sh of Huntingdon to ensure that the A and M of Ramsey had their fair from the Wed in Easter week until the eighth day, as set out in the charter of K Hen I and as they were accustomed to hold it in the time of his ancestors. (RLC, ii, p. 181b) Fair of St Ives held by A of Ramsey from Tues in Easter to Tues after Easter was noted 1234-5. The A claimed the tolls from the fair by a charter of K Hen II. The bailiffs of Huntingdon stated that they had a right to the customs of the fair by a charter of K John. They alleged that the A had sent armed men to the fair, who had impeded them and collected the customs to the damage of 40m.. An inquisition found that the fair was not held in the reign of K Hen I, but during K Ric I's reign. The baillifs of Huntingdon had always taken customs from the fair from the Tues, between the third hour and the ninth hour. They took this toll between the fair and the bridge. (CRR, xv, no. 1352) In 1234-5, the A of Ramsey stated that his fair lasted from Mon on the eve of Easter until Wed after the Sun after Easter. However, the sh of Huntingdon stated that until the reign of K Hen II, the fair had not been held on the Tues after the Sun after Easter. (CRR, xv, no. 1352) On 7 May 1258, K Hen III granted the A and C of Ramsey all the profit of the fair held at St Ives at Easter, notwithstanding that the fair was only granted to them for eight days, after which period the profits used to go to the king. This was in return for a payment of 500m. and ú50 each year in perpetuity. (CChR, 1257-1300, p. 10; E.W. Moore, 'The Fairs of Medieval England, an Introductory Study', (Toronto, 1985), p. 15) In 1286, the A of Ramsey claimed to hold the fair by a charter of K Hen I to the M of Ramsey.
